我自2004年入职华东理工大学，现任商学院教授，从事管理系统工程、创新扩散、电子商务、数字营销等方面的科研工作。我在天津大学获得了硕士和博士学位（1995-2001），博士期间师从[刘豹](http://come.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/7581.htm)教授。

I started working at East China University of Science and Technology in 2004, and I am currently a professor in the School of Business. My research focuses on management system engineering, innovation diffusion, e-commerce, and digital marketing. I obtained my master's and doctoral degrees from Tianjin University between 1995 and 2001, and during my doctoral studies, I was supervised by Professor [Liu Bao](http://come.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/7581.htm).
